# Bitcoin Tutorial Module

A simple, interactive tutorial that teaches the basics of how Bitcoin's digital signatures and ownership work.

## What is this?

I built this interactive tutorial to help people understand one of Bitcoin's core concepts - how digital signatures prove ownership without needing a central authority. It walks you through generating keys, signing transactions, and verifying signatures with some hands-on exercises.

## Features

- Generate a key pair and see how public/private keys work together
- Sign a transaction with your private key (drag and drop interface)
- Watch how the Bitcoin network verifies your signature
- Test your knowledge with a "spot the invalid transaction" challenge
- Track your progress through the module

## Tech Stack

- Next.js & React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion for animations
- Lucide React for icons

## Running the project

```bash
# Install dependencies
